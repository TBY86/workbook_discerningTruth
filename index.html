            <p>A Word of Advice - While there are stopping points built into this interactive workbook please consider really giving each prompt and section the time that is needed to fully digest the essence of the knowledge being presented to you. If the natural stopping points are the only markers used, your study sessions will likely last hours each day: who has that kind of time? And the whole workbook will be done in about 5 days. If God has granted you several hours a day, for a week, to go through this workbook - halleluYah! Otherwise, you should expect each section to take several days, if each section's prompts are to be digested fully, changing your life and doing miracles that will leave you stunned and grateful.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Welcome</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Shalom, my dear friend. I pray this activity is finding you curious and excited with anticipation. As humans, we have the proclivity to approach a workbook such as this one with the desire to "get through it". Instead, view this as an experience or a meal. Labor in the fields of this work differently. It will be worth it. This work, designed for your spiritual soundness and engineered to bolster you on the path towards salubrious spiritual study that will endow you with great riches of God's Kingdom will be a waste of time for some and life changing for others, dependant on how they approach it. Sit down, laboring to clear your mind of distractions and preconceived notions, planning to labor in this work until your spirit has been satisfied with a correction or some new piece of information.</p> 
            <p>If approached in this way, denying the fleshy traps and proclivities but instead listening to the wise counsel you are receiving from the throne room of Heaven, this workbook guides you through a structured, prayerful process to compare stories about Biblical figures from both extra-Biblical sources and Biblical sources - encouraging you to develop an eye that can recognize the distinctions between true character verse gossip - even that gossip has lasted millenia. The goal is to grow in more than discernment concerning Patriarchal characacter, but being able to discern fact from fiction, clean from unclean, holy from unholy: testing every narrative against truth (1 John 4:1; 2 Timothy 3:16–17).</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;">Navigate through the sections using the buttons above to begin your journey of discernment.</p>

                <h3>Important Instruction for This Section</h3>
                <p>In Sections 1 and 2 we examined the moral lessons, character portrayals, and potential impact of these stories on moral conclusions, wielding and submitting to authority, and faith.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>In this section, we set all moral or inspirational value completely aside.</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">A story can teach a powerful moral lesson and still be historically unreliable or even completely fraudulent in its origin. Conversely, a text can be morally appalling, yet historically authentic in that it its origins and claims are factual and authentic, as distasteful as it is when such a thing is revealed.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Moral authority or spiritual usefulness has <strong>no bearing</strong> on evaluating authenticity in terms of the text's being what it claims. Here we use <strong>only objective scholarly tools</strong> employed by textual critics (believers and non-believers alike) to assess evidence of a manuscript's or tradition's historical authenticity, age, and reliability—regardless of whether the content is edifying or problematic.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">When the workbook is complete, the conclusions drawn from this "objective tools" section of the workbook can be laid beside the "moral conclusions" section of the workbook to form a multi-witness framework to stand on.</p>

                <h3>Evaluating Authenticity: Tools for Discernment</h3>
                <p>Professional scholars (e.g., Wes Huff, Daniel Wallace, Bart Ehrman, James Charlesworth, and others) use the following objective criteria to determine whether an ancient text or tradition is likely authentic to its claimed time period or is a later composition/expansion attempting to falsely use its supposed age as proof of its authenticity.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Your task is to research and apply the following tools yourself using reputable academic sources. Journal your findings without letting moral or spiritual appeal influence your evaluation.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Use the texts we have been studying to do the following.</strong></p>

                    <li><strong>Anachronisms and Cultural/Name Usage</strong><br>

                    <li><strong>Chain of Transmission</strong><br>
                    Is there evidence of a continuous, careful scribal tradition from the claimed time of composition to the surviving copies? Or are there signs of later interpolation, expansion, or fabrication?</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Historical Canonicity Criteria</strong><br>
                    Was the text widely accepted as authoritative by the early Jewish or Christian communities? Was it associated with a known prophet, apostle, or eyewitness generation?</li>

                <h3>Application Prompt</h3>
                <p>Select at least three of these tools. Using reliable scholarly resources (academic books, peer-reviewed articles, lectures by textual critics, or university-level introductions to textual criticism: Youtube influencers do not count if that is their only accolade), apply them to both the extra-Biblical idol accounts and the Biblical Genesis account of Abraham's early life and calling.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Record only what the evidence indicates—set aside any personal feelings about the stories' moral value.</strong></p>
                <p>Note: This exercise is very time-consuming, but then again, so is researching the mountain of Apocryphal books. A list of resources is provided below to help you get started on this journey. AI can be helpful—when it is accurate—for comparing and contrasting literary styles if you prompt it properly and know how to use the tool perspicaciously. However, if you simply lack the time or resources to complete this section of the study, below the resources section is a small compilation of free YouTube videos created by men who have dedicated their lives to using these tools to discern what is and isn’t authentic in the vast sea of manuscripts that speak of God. If the video path is the way for you, instead of doing your own research you will have to trust both the men in the videos and me for providing these videos as what I consider to be more or less trustworthy on this particular topic - for the most part.</p>
